  <h1>About</h1>

  <p class="page2-text" >
    I'm Gwyneth and I created this website during the Girls Who Code Fall 2024 Program. I was inspired to create this website because I see the present of inequality in today's world and I wanted to raise awareness about it. Hopefully, this website can give you insight and motivate you to take action.
